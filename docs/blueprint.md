## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated red (#E63946) evokes the richness of tomato and Italian flavors, aligning with the essence of pizza. It is vivid and appetizing.
- Background color: Light pink (#F1FAEE), is a gentle variation of the red, which softens the overall look and is inviting. The desaturation prevents it from competing with the red.
- Accent color: A slightly darker, more vibrant shade of orange (#F4A261). As an analogous color, it complements the primary red and helps focus the user's attention on important elements like order confirmations and checkouts. It creates warmth and visual interest without clashing.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and approachable feel. It is versatile for headlines and body text, and is easy to read on screens.
- Use custom icons for each pizza base, sauce, cheese, and veggie option.
- Utilize a grid-based layout to present the pizza customization options in a structured manner.
- Use subtle animations when adding toppings to the pizza or when confirming an order.
